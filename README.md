[![Codeship](https://codeship.com/projects/156160/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/156160)


The PDT extension group is a collobaration of PDT plugin maintainers to build a central PDT extension platform and codebase.

Currently the core plugin supports following features:

- [PHP Coding Standard Fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/) integration
- ~~Use-Statement validation (injecting of missing use statements through quick-fixes)~~ - _PDT since 5.0 have own implementation_
- ~~Class / Interface dialog~~ - _PDT since 5.0 have own dialogs_
- ~~Implementation of missing interface/abstract classes methods~~ - _PDT since 5.0 have own implementation_
- ~~Assign to local variable quick-fix~~ - _Moved to PDT 4.0_
- ~~Import statements outline filters~~ - _PDT since 3.5 have same filters_
- Unused / uninitialized variable validator
- ~~PHP Refactoring support~~ - _PDT since 3.4 have own refactoring support_


We are in the process of migrating general functionality of our plugins into the core plugin, and add more core features for
other PDT extenders.
